 * This was a short experiment (and a failed one, as the post was always rejected by Mastodon inbox)
 * and is currently on-hold, pending further research into whether a SpringSocial ActivityPub implementation
 * will ever exist, and while looking for better way than 'hand-coding' an entire ActivityPub protocol
 * myself in java...but there definitely doesn't seem to be any available in Java.
